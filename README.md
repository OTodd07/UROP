# UROP Project

This is an open ended project with the purpose of understanding more about deep learning with relation to image processing.

## DCGAN

A deep convolutional network used to produce MNIST data images with a generator and discriminator component.

## VAE

A generative model using a variational auto-encoder technique to produce MNIST images


## CNN Model Comparison

Including LeNet, ResNet and VGG

## Spatial Transform
Seeing the effect on accuracy of applying spacial transformation to the images before running them through the model
